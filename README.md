#Rock,Paper and scissor game

For this rock, paper, and scissor game you can type uppercase ROCK, PAPER or SCISSOR. Also if you want to you can do it lowercase too. Make sure your spelling is correct or the program
well not except it as round, point nor a error. It will just play back to the start. Next you have three mistakes to make if you make three spelling mistake gameover. I hope you love 
the game. Dear Antoine Demount Price jr.
